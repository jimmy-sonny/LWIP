A simple but effective lightweight mitm, based on the implementation of LWIP from Adam Dunkels <adam@sics.se>

The Slides/ folder contains the presentation of the project.
The Implementation/ folder contains the actual implementation of the mitm based on lwip.
Implementation/MITM/ folder contains the app, based on Socket API, for the mitm.
Implementation/LWIP/ folder contains the software of TCP/IP stack in two version, a slow, but stable one, and a fast, but unstable one.


To compile, use the makefile in MITM/main/Works only on Unix BSD based systems.
